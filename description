This project focuses on developing a deep learning-based DDoS detection and mitigation system within a Software-Defined Networking (SDN) environment.
The system utilizes a Deep Neural Network (DNN) trained on the InSDN dataset to classify incoming network traffic as either normal or malicious. 
The goal is to create an intelligent and adaptive detection model that can identify attack patterns in real time and assist the SDN controller in dynamically responding to threats.
By leveraging SDNâ€™s centralized control and programmability, the model enables automated mitigation actions such as blocking malicious IP addresses or rerouting suspicious flows, thus maintaining network stability and performance.
The proposed framework emphasizes high detection accuracy, low false-positive rates, and real-time decision-making capabilities. 
It also demonstrates how machine learning can be integrated into SDN controllers to create self-defending network infrastructures.
The project highlights the effectiveness of DNNs in learning complex network behaviors and provides a foundation for deploying intelligent security systems in modern, software-driven network architectures.
